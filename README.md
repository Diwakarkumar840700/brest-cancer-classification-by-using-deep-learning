Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection through regular screening is crucial for effective treatment. This project employs deep learning techniques to classify breast cancer images, aiming to provide a reliable tool for early diagnosis.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of histopathological images of breast tissue. The images are labeled as either benign or malignant. The dataset can be obtained from [source link or description].

Dataset Structure
Training set: Used to train the model.
Validation set: Used to tune the model parameters.
Test set: Used to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Architecture
The deep learning model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to extract features from images and classify them. The architecture consists of:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction
Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
Fully connected layers for classification
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
Softmax activation for output classification
Training
The model is trained using the following parameters:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Binary Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Epochs: [Number of epochs]
Batch size: [Batch size]
Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall (Sensitivity): Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive cases.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
